Sea Level Predictor 🌊:-
Analyze the global average sea level changes since 1880 and predict future trends up to 2050 using Python, leveraging essential libraries for data analysis and visualization.

📖 Project Overview:-
This project utilizes historical data from the US Environmental Protection Agency to study the rise in global sea levels. The model employs scientific analysis and predictive modeling to forecast future sea-level changes. It provides an interactive tool for visualizing both historical and projected data trends.

Key Features:-
- Generate scatter plots for visual analysis of sea level trends.
- Use linear regression to estimate the future rise in sea levels.
- Create dual best-fit lines:
- One based on the entire dataset.
- Another focusing on data from the year 2000 onward.
- Predict sea level changes for the year 2050.
  
Data Source:-The dataset is derived from Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change (1880–2014) provided by:
- CSIRO, 2015
- NOAA, 2015

💻 Development Workflow:-
- Analyze Historical Data:
Import the dataset using Pandas (epa-sea-level.csv) and perform exploratory data analysis.
- Visualize Data:
Create scatter plots using Matplotlib, with the following:
- X-axis: Years (1880-2014).
- Y-axis: CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level (inches).
- Model Predictions with Linear Regression:
Utilize Scipy's linregress function to:
- Extract the slope and y-intercept for the line of best fit.
- Plot and extend the line through 2050.
- Refined Analysis:
Create a new line of best fit focused exclusively on data post-2000. Use it to project the rate of sea-level rise in the coming decades.
- Enhance Outputs:
Generate a descriptive and professional visualization, including:
- Title: "Rise in Sea Level."
- X-label: "Year."
- Y-label: "Sea Level (inches)."

🛠️ Getting Started:-
